# Wave - All-in-One Messaging App

Wave is an open source, comprehensive messaging solution aiming to revolutionize the way we communicate. By centralizing SMS, MMS, server messaging, email, and other messaging types into one application, Wave intends to provide an integrated and seamless communication experience. This project utilizes Typescript, Svelte and SQLite for app development and Rust for server-side messaging.

## Technologies

-   Tauri for creating cross-platform desktop (and soon mobile) applications
-   Typescript for app development
-   Sveltekit for creating the user interface
-   Bun for building and optimizing code
-   Vite for efficient development and building
-   Rust for server-side messaging
-   SQLite for local and server-side database storage

## Features

### Comprehensive Messaging

Wave aims to support a broad range of messaging types including:

-   SMS/MMS
-   Server Messaging
-   Email
-   Phone calls
-   Voice and video calls
-   File sharing
-   And more

This wide array of messaging options allows users to consolidate their communications into one convenient platform.

## Cross-Platform Synchronization

Wave will support cross-platform synchronization. This allows users to seamlessly switch between devices (PC, mobile, tablet) and even send SMS from a computer when a phone is connected.

## Customization

One of the key aspects of Wave is its high level of customization. Wave plans to offer a wide range of options for modifying the user interface and the functionality of the app to suit individual needs and preferences.

## Multilingual Support and Chat Translation

To make Wave accessible to users around the world, we intend to offer multilingual support and chat translation.

## Security

In this digital era, security is paramount. Wave is designed with this principle in mind, intending to offer end-to-end encryption and local encryption options for every type of messaging. We are even considering the potential of implementing post quantum cryptography to stay one step ahead of potential threats.

## Current Progress

Please bear in mind that Wave is still in the early stages of development. The features described above are the goals we're working towards. We are making steady progress, and we're excited about the potential of this project.
