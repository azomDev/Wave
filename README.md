# Wave - All-in-One Messaging App

## Important: this project is on hold for some time until we can get a better idea of how to approach this.

Wave is an open source, comprehensive messaging solution aiming to revolutionize the way we communicate. By centralizing SMS, MMS, server messaging, email, and other messaging types into one application, Wave intends to provide an integrated and seamless communication experience.

On top of that, Wave aims to be very secure.

## Features

### Comprehensive Messaging

Wave aims to support a broad range of messaging types including:

-   SMS/MMS
-   Server Messaging
-   External messaging integration
-   Email
-   Phone calls
-   Voice and video calls
-   File sharing
-   And more

This wide array of messaging options allows users to consolidate their communications into one convenient platform.

## Cross-Platform Synchronization

Wave will support cross-platform synchronization. This allows users to seamlessly switch between devices (PC, mobile, tablet) and even send SMS from a computer when a phone is connected.

## Customization

One of the key aspects of Wave is its high level of customization. Wave plans to offer a wide range of options for modifying the user interface and the functionality of the app to suit individual needs and preferences. For example, the UI will be entirely constumizable, to the point of being able to using a built-in api to do things like send messages, show messages and much more.

## Multilingual Support and Chat Translation

To make Wave accessible to users around the world, we intend to offer multilingual support and chat translation.

## Security

In this digital era, security is paramount. Wave is designed with this principle in mind, intending to offer end-to-end encryption and local encryption options for every type of messaging. We are even considering the potential of implementing post quantum cryptography to stay one step ahead of potential threats.

## Current Progress

Please bear in mind that Wave is still in the early stages of development. The features described above are the goals we're working towards. We are making steady progress, and we're excited about the potential of this project.

Stay tuned to this space for updates on our progress and ways you can get involved. If you're excited about Wave and want to contribute, feel free to reach out or start contributing on our issues page.
