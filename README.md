# Wave - All-in-One Messaging App

Wave is an open source, comprehensive messaging solution aiming to revolutionize the way we communicate. By centralizing SMS, MMS, server messaging, email, and other messaging types into one application, Wave intends to provide an integrated and seamless communication experience. 

**Please note that this project is still in its early stages of development.**

## Features

### Comprehensive Messaging
Wave aims to support a broad range of messaging types including:

- SMS
- MMS
- Server Messaging
- Email
- And more

This wide array of messaging options allows users to consolidate their communications into one convenient platform.

### Customization
One of the key aspects of Wave is its high level of customization. Wave plans to offer a wide range of options for modifying the user interface and the functionality of the app to suit individual needs and preferences.

### Security
In this digital era, security is paramount. Wave is designed with this principle in mind, intending to offer encryption options for every type of messaging. We are even considering the potential of implementing post quantum cryptography to stay one step ahead of potential threats.
